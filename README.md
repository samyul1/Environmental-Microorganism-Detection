# Environmental-Microorganism-Detection

In the aqueous tapestry that sustains life, the role of environmental microorganisms (EMs) in water takes center stage, especially when it comes to the paramount concern of public health. Every drop of water tells a story, and within it, microscopic actors play a crucial part. Detecting these environmental microorganisms is not just a scientific endeavor but a vital step in safeguarding communities against waterborne threats. From identifying potential pathogens that could jeopardize public health to ensuring the purity of our drinking water sources, the microscopic world within water holds the answers. By delving into the unseen realms, we equip ourselves with the knowledge needed to protect the most fundamental resource we all shareâ€”clean and safe water for the well-being of everyone.

## Dataset
The overall dataset is made up of the following two datasets:

Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset Seventh Version is a microscopic image data set containing 41 types of EMs, with 2,65 images and 13,216 labeled objects in XML Format.
Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset Sixth Version is a microscopic image data set containing 21 types of EMs. Each type of EM contains 40 original and 40 GT images, in total 1680 EM ages. Box annotations were generated using the Roboflow tool, generating XML and YoloV8 files.
